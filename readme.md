# Lima Limpia

Lima Limpia is a waste-collection system for Peru. It gives municipal teams a
view of routes and trucks, and gives citizens a way to check truck locations and
report collection problems.

This repository is a Bun workspace monorepo. The API owns validation, business
rules, and database writes. The web and mobile apps call the API.

## Get started

You need Bun 1.4 and a PostgreSQL database. Supabase works well for local
development.

1. Copy the environment template and fill in the required values:

   ```sh
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```sh
   bun install
   ```

3. Create the database schema:

   ```sh
   bun --filter @lima-garbage/database db:push
   ```

4. Create the first organization owner:

   ```sh
   bun --filter @lima-garbage/database setup:admin
   ```

5. Add sample trucks, users, a route, and an assignment if needed:

   ```sh
   bun --filter @lima-garbage/database db:seed
   ```

6. Start the API:

   ```sh
   bun --filter @lima-garbage/api dev
   ```

The API listens on `http://localhost:4000` by default. Start the web app in a
second terminal:

```sh
bun --filter @lima-garbage/web dev
```

The web app expects `API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000`. See
[`apps/api/readme.md`](apps/api/readme.md) for the endpoint reference.

## Repository layout

| Path | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| [`apps/api`](apps/api) | Hono API. It owns authentication, business rules, and database writes. |
| [`apps/web`](apps/web) | Next.js dashboard for municipal staff. Server actions call the API. |
| [`apps/citizen`](apps/citizen) | Expo app for citizens. It shows trucks, handles reports, and stores the session in secure storage. |
| [`apps/server`](apps/server) | `json-server` prototype. It is not part of the production data flow. |
| [`packages/database`](packages/database) | Drizzle schema, migrations, and database tooling. |
| [`packages/email`](packages/email) | React Email templates used by the API. |
| [`datasets`](datasets) | Marimo notebooks for public waste and population datasets. |

The runtime data flow and package boundaries are shown in
[`ARCHITECTURE.md`](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Development commands

Run these commands from the repository root:

```sh
bun --filter @lima-garbage/api test
bun run format
bun run format:check
bun run lint
bun --filter @lima-garbage/citizens start
bun --filter @lima-garbage/citizens dev
cd datasets && mise run install && mise run dev
```

The citizen app has native dependencies, so Expo Go is not enough. Use an EAS
development build or a local Android build. Its setup is documented in
[`apps/citizen/readme.md`](apps/citizen/readme.md).
