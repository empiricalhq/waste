# API

The API is a Hono application in `apps/api`. Run it locally with Bun:

```sh
bun --filter @lima-garbage/api dev
```

The default base URL is `http://localhost:4000`. Every application route is
under `/api`, so the health check is `GET /api/health`.

## Authentication

Email and password sessions are managed by [Better Auth](https://www.better-auth.com/docs).
A successful sign-in sets the `better-auth.session_token` cookie. Send that
cookie with every protected request.

Staff requests need an active organization and one of these member roles:

```text
owner  admin  supervisor  driver
```

Citizen requests need an authenticated session without an active organization.
The API checks this rule even when a client has already checked it.

Custom API responses wrap successful data in `{ "data": ... }` and errors in
`{ "error": "..." }`. Better Auth routes keep Better Auth's response shape.

## Routes

The following routes are implemented in this application. Request bodies use
the field names shown in the database and API contracts.

### Health

| Method | Path | Auth | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/health` | None | Return API status and the current timestamp. |

### Authentication

Better Auth handles all requests under `/api/auth`.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/sign-in/email` | Sign in with `email` and `password`. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/sign-up/email` | Create a user with `name`, `email`, and `password`. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/sign-out` | End the current session. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/get-session` | Return the current user and session. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/request-password-reset` | Request a reset email. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/reset-password` | Set a new password with a reset token. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/organization/list` | List organizations for the current user. |
| `POST` | `/api/auth/organization/set-active` | Set the active organization with `organizationId`. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/organization/get-full-organization` | Return the active organization and its members. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/organization/get-active-member` | Return the current organization member. |
| `GET` | `/api/auth/organization/get-active-member-role` | Return the current member role. |

Better Auth exposes more routes than the application uses directly. Check its
installed API types before adding a new call.

### Staff

All `/api/admin` routes require an active organization and the `owner`, `admin`,
or `supervisor` member role.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/drivers` | List drivers. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/drivers` | Create a driver with `name`, `email`, and `password`. |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/trucks` | List active trucks and their current assignment data. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/trucks` | Create a truck with `name` and `license_plate`. |
| `DELETE` | `/api/admin/trucks/:id` | Deactivate a truck. |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/routes` | List active routes. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/routes` | Create a route with coordinates, duration, and at least one waypoint. |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/routes/:id/waypoints` | List a route's waypoints. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/assignments` | Assign a route, truck, and driver with start and end timestamps. |
| `GET` | `/api/admin/issues` | List open citizen and driver issues. |
| `POST` | `/api/admin/issues` | Create an issue with `type`, coordinates, and an optional description. |

Route creation accepts `start_lat`, `start_lng`,
`estimated_duration_minutes`, and this waypoint shape:

```json
{
  "lat": -12.0464,
  "lng": -77.0428,
  "sequence_order": 1
}
```

Assignment creation accepts `route_id`, `truck_id`, `driver_id`,
`scheduled_start_time`, and `scheduled_end_time`. The server sets
`assigned_date` from the current date.

### Driver

All `/api/driver` routes require the `driver` member role.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/driver/route/current` | Return the driver's next scheduled or active assignment. |
| `POST` | `/api/driver/assignments/:id/start` | Start a scheduled assignment. |
| `POST` | `/api/driver/assignments/:id/complete` | Complete an active assignment. |
| `POST` | `/api/driver/location` | Save the current location for the active truck. |
| `POST` | `/api/driver/issues` | Report an issue for the active assignment. |

Location requests require `lat` and `lng`. `speed` and `heading` are optional.

### Citizen

All `/api/citizen` routes require an authenticated user without an active
organization.

| Method | Path | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET` | `/api/citizen/trucks` | List active trucks with available locations. |
| `GET` | `/api/citizen/truck/status` | Return the nearest active truck status for the user's saved location. |
| `PUT` | `/api/citizen/profile/location` | Save the user's `lat` and `lng`. |
| `POST` | `/api/citizen/issues` | Report a missed collection, illegal dumping, or other issue. |
| `GET` | `/api/citizen/issues` | List the current user's reports. |

Citizen issue requests use `type`, `lat`, and `lng`. `description` and
`photo_url` are optional. Valid types are `missed_collection`,
`illegal_dumping`, and `other`.

## Errors

The API returns these status codes for its custom routes:

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `400` | The body, path parameter, or referenced resource is invalid. |
| `401` | The request has no valid session. |
| `403` | The session has the wrong role or organization state. |
| `404` | The resource does not exist or cannot be used in its current state. |
| `409` | The request conflicts with an existing database record. |
| `500` | An unexpected server error occurred. |

## Environment

Copy [`../../.env.example`](../../.env.example) to `.env`. The API requires:

- `DATABASE_URL`
- `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`
- `RESEND_API_KEY`

`BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `PORT`, `CORS_ORIGINS`, `TRUSTED_ORIGINS`, and the email
sender settings have development defaults.

## Deploy

The local server uses Bun. The checked-in Wrangler configuration builds a
Cloudflare Worker:

```sh
bun --filter @lima-garbage/api build:worker
bun --filter @lima-garbage/api deploy
```

Set secrets with Wrangler before deploying:

```sh
cd apps/api
bun x wrangler secret put DATABASE_URL
bun x wrangler secret put BETTER_AUTH_SECRET
bun x wrangler secret put RESEND_API_KEY
```
